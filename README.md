### ImageQueueLoader
Load Images in Queue, it is possible to obtain metadata information, such as seed, from the generated images in a queue. 
We can retrieve seeds sequentially during sequential execution.

### LoadImagealpha
Load Image with alpha, it works when transparent images exits. Built-in load-image extension output is "RGB" default, not "RGBA".

Of course, we can also use the built-in load image of Comfyui, but it needs to be used in conjunction with a mask.

### TrimBG
We can also batch read images and process them. Better with [Load Image List From Dir](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack?tab=readme-ov-file#image-util), list, not batch.

And, Better to use with [ComfyUI_BiRefNet_ll](https://github.com/lldacing/ComfyUI_BiRefNet_ll)

### TxtSave
Save txt file with input file path and name if "src_mode" enable.![txtSave](./assets/txt_save.png)
### ScaleMultiPixels
Scale image to multiple pixels.
A input picture pixels is 533 * 433, if base_pixel set 100, output will be 500 * 400.
